Securely install the latest [maturin[zig]](https://pypi.org/project/maturin/) release from PyPI.

This action installs a pinned version of **maturin[zig]** and all its dependencies,         making sure that file hashes match. Pinning your dependencies stops supply chain attacks where an adversary         replaces maturin[zig] or one of its dependencies with malicious code.

## Usage

In your GitHub Actions workflow, use this action like so:

```yaml
      - name: Install maturin[zig] from PyPI
        uses: install-pinned/maturin-with-zig@ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```

## Alternatives

This action is a relatively simple wrapper around the fantastic [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.rtfd.io)         and is most useful if there is no existing `requirements.txt`/`poetry.lock`/... infrastructure in place.         If you already pin all your dependencies in a single place, you don't need it!
